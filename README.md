```python
from continuous_training import ContinuousTrainingSystem

# Initialize system
system = ContinuousTrainingSystem(update_interval=300, min_models=3)

# Start continuous training
system.start_continuous_system(initial_data)

# Get latest predictions
prediction = system.get_latest_prediction()

# Stop system
system.stop_continuous_system()
```
